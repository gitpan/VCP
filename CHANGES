CHANGES for vcp - Version CoPy

0.21 - In development
   - Fixed VCP::Dest::p4; it was adding too many directories to a file, so
     files ended up with the first directory or two repeated. reported by david
     d zuhn <zoo@bravara.com>
   - Cleaned up undefined var use in VCP::Utils::p4, reported by david d zuhn
     <zoo@bravara.com>
   - Fixed VCP::Dest::revml's decision making so it will choose base64 encoding
     when faced with lots of NULs on input.  Reported by david d zuhn
     <zoo@bravara.com>.
   - Added a couple of compression thoughts for revml output to TODO.
   - Reworked VCP::Dest::revml's base64 encoding logic to be more efficient in
     time and in generated output.
   - Changed the test suite to use base64 for the "binary" file, and to use
     character codes from 0x00 to 0x07 in rotation to make sure binary data
     goes through ok.
   - refactored 90p4.t and 90cvs.t into VCP::TestUtils to make test maint.
     easier.  Now you don't have to be clinically insane to work on the test
     suite.  At least not all the time.
   - Added p4->revml, cvs->revml, cvs->p4->revml tests for the re-rooting
     feature.

0.2 - Thu Jul 19 00:18:34 EDT 2001
   - *** VCP::Dest::p4 now uses a depot spec (//depot/...) instead of a file
     spec on the local filesystem.  This differs from VCP::Source::p4 until I
     can upgrade it. The p4 where command is no longer used.
   - *** VCP::Dest::p4 now uses it's own client view pointing in to the temp
     directory. This should solve the link() failures when going from cvs to
     p4, since VCP::Source::cvs and VCP::Dest::p4 will both use the same temp
     dir. This should also make normal usage a bit easier, since the user need
     not create a client spec, etc.
   - Altered labelsync to use p4's "-x -", now the huge lists of labelled files
     that david d zuhn <zoo@bravara.com>'s CVS repository has are passed to p4
     on stdin instead of blowing up the command line.
   - VCP::Dest::p4 now passes absolute paths to the working files to p4
     labelsync instead of paths relative to rev_root. Reported by david d zuhn
     <zoo@bravara.com>.
   - Remove -f (force_missing) option from VCP::Source::cvs. It is now the
     default behavior. If need be, we can add an option to not force_missing in
     case extraneous files get brought along, but we'll wait for user demand.
   - Tweak deduce_rev_root algorithm to take the entire path given if no
     wildcards are present.
   - Added debug logging of command-line options, which is helpful when vcp is
     run by a script, such as our test scripts. Use the VCPDEBUG environment
     variable to enable this, set it to something like ".*" or "main".
   - Fixed documentation for --debug (the spec is required and it's not a
     shellish re, it's a perl5 re).
   - Fixed docs and comments for VCP::Source::cvs's -d options (was -D)
   - Deprecated the wacky VCP::Plugin::AUTOLOAD which was used to make things
     like $self->p4( [ options ], redirects ) work.  So far, only VCP::Dest::p4
     uses the new VCP::Plugin::run_safely() API, but the others will be
     upgraded.
   - Added a VCP::Utils::p4 to contain code that is used by VCP::Dest::p4 and
     which will soon be used by VCP::Source::p4. Expect a VCP::Utils::cvs to
     come along, too.

0.1 Wed Jul  4 00:27:35 EDT 2001
   - Fix VCP::Dest::p4 to take the filespec from the p4:<dest> spec and
     use it as the rev_root.  No --rev-root option at this time, not sure
     if it's needed.  Reported by david d zuhn <zoo@bravara.com>.

0.091 Thu Jun  7 08:32:15 EDT 2001
   - Fix bug in CVS log file parsing that was causing it to think it was seeing
     all revisions as revisions of the first file it saw ("====... lines were
     being ignored) as the first file. Reported by Matthew Attaway.

0.09 Thu May 24 17:15:38 EDT 2001
   - Debugged and beefed up the CVS log file parsing code.  It can still be
     fooled by revision comments (the "message" field) things that mimic 
     the output of `cvs log`, like a line beginning with the right number
     of "-" characters, but it's more robust.
   - Underscorify CVS tags. Reported by Matthew Attaway.
   - Only warn about undeleted files when in debugging mode, also
     reported by Matthew Attaway.  The warning's there because we
     don't want to use too much disk space, but it gets in the way
     when an exception is thrown, since the END {...} handlers kick in
     before some (often many) the VCP::Rev objects are DESTROYed.

0.08 Wed May 23 10:18:28 EDT 2001
   - Stop using p4 print -s, it puts a newline in every 4097 characters.
     Reported by Nick Ing-Simmons.
   - Require p4d >= 99.2 because we need filelog's -m option. Reported
     by Nick Ing-Simmons.  Updated t/90cvs.t, t/90p4.t, and
     lib/VCP/TestUtils.pm to improve detection of stale p4ds.
   - Fix a "use strict" problem in lib/VCP/TestUtils.pm, reported
     by Nick Ing-Simmons.

0.07 Tue May 22 16:07:48 EDT 2001
   - Minnor documentation changes.

0.066 Mon May 21 10:34:50 EDT 2001
   - Remove PWD from the environment when calling the p4 command, so as to
     force it to use the cwd()
   - Improve logging of the directory the p4 command (and all commands) are
     being run in.
   - Many thanks to Matthew Attaway for help in finding and testing this one.

0.064 Tue May  8 11:26:11 EDT 2001
   - Some versions of patch have problems handling embedded NUL (\0x00)
     characters. Fixed gentrevml and VCP::Dest::revml to not generate
     deltas for files containing them. If a file contains a NUL, it will
     sent in it's entirety, though it might or might not be base64 encoded.

0.063 Tue Apr 24 23:57:28 EDT 2001
   - Fixed bug in parsing of repo specs (scheme:user:passwd@server:files)

0.062 Tue Apr 17 14:07:48 EDT 2001
   - Added the requirement to install expat first to INSTALL
   - Commented out the call to "vcp help" to prevent perldoc from whining
     when run as root.  Notified Brad Appleton, Pod::Usage's maintainer
     to see what might be done, but it's not a big deal for me unless
     an actual, real live user runs "vcp help" when logged in as root.
   - Converted shift to be CORE::shift in VCP::Revs, sinne perl 5.6.1
     now complains that it had to resolve shift as CORE::shift due to
     the sub shift in there.

0.061 Sun Apr 15 15:56:32 EDT 2001
   - Removed a couple of 5.6.0 dependancies
   - require perl 5.00503 in Makefile.PL, not sure how far back we could
     easily go.
   - Added logic to t/*.t to set -I more robustly by calling
     File::Spec->abs2rel on @INC and the path to bin/vcp and pass them
     on to child perls, so they could find their libraries.  This fixed
     a nasty chicken-and-egg problem whereby you could only run the tests
     after installing.
   - t/90cvs.t and t/90p4.t use File::Spec->tmpdir for the repositories
     and workspaces they build.  They also delete these temp dirs when
     done.
   - Made Makefile.PL require a minimum of XML::AutoWriter v.036

0.06 Wed Dec 20 23:19:15 EST 2000
   - bin/vcp: Added --versions, which loads all modules and checks them
     for a $VERSION and print the results out.  This should help with
     diagnosing out-of-sync modules.
   - Added $VERSION vars to a few modules :-).  Forgot to increment any
     $VERSION strings.
   - VCP::Dest::cvs: The directory "deeply" was not being `cvs add`ed on
     paths like "a/deeply/nested/file", assuming "deeply" had no files
     in it.
   - VCP::Dest::revml: fixed a bug that was causing files with a lot of
     linefeeds to be emitted in base64 instead of deltaed.  This means
     most text files.
   - Various minor cleanups of diagnostics and error messages, including
     exposing "Can't locate Foo.pm" when a VCP::Source or VCP::Dest
     module depends on a module that's not installed, as reported by
     Jeff Anton.  

0.05 Mon Dec 18 07:27:53 EST 2000
   - Use `p4 labels //...@label` command as per Rober Cowham's suggestion, with
     the '-s' flag recommended by Christopher Siewald and
     Amaury.FORGEOTDARC@atsm.fr.  Though it's actually something like 
       
       vcp: running /usr/bin/p4 -u safari -c safari -p localhost:5666 -s files
       //.../NtLkly //...@compiler_a3 //.../NtLkly //...@compiler_may3
       
     and so //on //for 50 parameters to get the speed up.  I use the
     //.../NtLkly "file" as //a separator between the lists of files in various
     //revisions.  Hope nobody has any files named that :-).  What I should do
     is choose a random label that doesn't occur in the labels list, I guess.
   - VCP::Source::revml and VCP::Dest::revml are now binary, control code, and
     "hibit ASCII" (I know, that's an oxymoron) clean.  The <comment>, <delta>,
     and <content> elements now escape anything other than tab, line feed,
     space, or printable chars (32 <= c <= ASCII 126) using a tag like '<char
     code="0x09">'.  The test suite tests all this.  Filenames should also
     be escaped this way, but I didn't get to that.
   - The decision whether to do deltas or encode the content in base64 is now
     based on how many characters would need to be escaped.
   - We now depend on the users' diff program to have a "-a" option to force it
     to diff even if the files look binary to it.  I need to use Diff.pm and
     adapt it for use on binary data.
   - VCP::Dest::cvs now makes sure that no two consecutive revisions of the
     same file have the same mod_time.  VCP::Source::p4 got so fast at pulling
     revisions from the repositories the test suite sets up that CVS was not
     noticing that files had changed.
   - VCP::Plugin now allows you to set a list of acceptable result codes, since
     we now use p4 in ways that make it return non-zero result codes.
   - VCP::Revs now croaks if you try to add two entries of the same VCP::Rev
     (ie matching filename and rev_id).
   - The <type> tag is now limited to "text" or "binary", and is meant to
     pass that level of info between foreign repositories.
   - The <p4_info> on each file now carries the one line p4 description of
     the file so that p4->p4 transferes can pick out the more detailed
     info.  VCP::Source::p4, VCP::Dest::p4 do this.
   - VCP::{Source,Dest}::{p4,cvs} now set binaryness on added files properly,
     I think.  For p4->p4, the native p4 type is preserved.  For CVS sources,
     seeing the keyword substitution flag 'o' or 'b' implies binaryness, for
     p4, seeing a filetype like qr/u?x?binary/ or qr/x?tempobj/ or "resource"
     implies binaryness (to non-p4 destinations).  NOTE: Seeing a 'o' or 'b'
     in a CVS source only ends up setting the 'b' option on the destination.
     That should be ok for most uses, but we can make it smarter for cvs->cvs
     transfers if need be.

0.04 Tue Dec 12 00:15:57 EST 2000
   - Reorg of VCP::Source::p4
     - One large filelog command is run instead of many small ones.
       This takes advantage of the -m option to make sure enough changes
       are listed.  Many extra revisions of most files are probably
       listed, but listing and ignoring them is quicker than spawning p4
       over and over.  Wish p4 filelog had a revision range...
     - it now doesn't suck the entire filelog output in to memory, it
       parses it line by line as it's emitted from the `p4 filelog`
     - `p4 print` is now used to print a bunch of files at once, using
       the header line to separate one file from the next, kind of like
       splitting a mime-encoded message.  There's a very slight chance
       that it will misjudge the boundary between two files if a file
       happens to have a line that looks very much like the header line
       for the next file.  This is pretty unlikely and I'll fix it if it
       crops up.  I could batch them more, right now it never puts two
       revisions of the same filename in the same batch, for no really
       good reason.  Another method might be to batch 25 or 50 revs each
       time.
     - it turns out there's a problem spawning multiple p4 commands at
       the same time against the same p4d (p4d is 99.2, FWIW).  Or at
       least running large `p4 files ...` while there's a large `p4
       filelog` still also running.
     - filelog lines beginning with "... ..." are now ignored.  These
       are notifications of copy, branch, and integrate events that we
       don't yet do anything with.
     - deleted cur() and P4_CUR
     - deleted P4_IS_INCREMENTAL
   - Made an assertion in VCP::Dest::revml::handle_rev() a little
     clearer
   - Added some ok(1) calls to 90p4.t to make it easier to figure out
     which child process is whining or aborting
   - Made the message that's printed when a subcommand emits unexpected
     output say "stderr" instead of "stdout".
   - Cleaned up documentation for VC::Plugin::work_path().

0.03 Sun Dec 10 13:14:07 EST 2000
   - Cleaned up VCP::Source::p4 a bit.  It doesn't whine as much now
     when it sees what it considers to be old news in the log file.
   - Added an easy way to monitor the commands being issued to a
     repository: simply add "::cmd" to the debug spec for that source:

	vcp -d Source::cvs::cvs
        vcp -d Dest::p4::p4

   - The next step is to use the -m option to p4 filelog to speed things
     up.

0.02 Tue Dec  5 01:20:31 EST 2000
   - VCP::Dest::p4 now does change number aggregation based on the
     comment field changing or whenever a new revision of a file with
     unsubmitted changes shows up on the input stream.  Since revisions of
     files are normally sorted in time order, this should work in a number
     of cases.  I'm sure we'll need to generalize it, perhaps with a time
     thresholding function.
   - t/90cvs.t now tests cvs->p4 replication.
   - VCP::Dest::p4 now doesn't try to `p4 submit` when no changes are
     pending.
   - VCP::Rev now prevents the same label from being applied twice to
     a revision.  This was occuring because the "r_1"-style label that
     gets added to a target revision by VCP::Dest::p4 could duplicate
     a label "r_1" that happened to already be on a revision.
   - Added t/00rev.t, the beginnings of a test suite for VCP::Rev.
   - Tweaked bin/gentrevml to comment revisions with their change number
     instead of using a unique comment for every revision for non-p4
     t/test-*-in-0.revml files.  This was necessary to test cvs->p4
     functionality.

0.01 Sat Dec  2 23:10:43 EST 2000
   - First public release.  Moderately functional alpha code.  Supports
     p4, cvs, RevML.  Expect APIs, UIs and enerthing else to change before
     things settle down.
