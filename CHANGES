CHANGES for vcp - Version CoPy

0.03 Sun Dec 10 13:14:07 EST 2000
   - Cleaned up VCP::Source::p4 a bit.  It doesn't whine as much now
     when it sees what it considers to be old news in the log file.
   - Added an easy way to monitor the commands being issued to a
     repository: simply add "::cmd" to the debug spec for that source:

	vcp -d Source::cvs::cvs
        vcp -d Dest::p4::p4

   - The next step is to use the -m option to p4 filelog to speed things
     up.

   - VCP::Dest::p4 now does change number aggregation based on the
     comment field changing or whenever a new revision of a file with
     unsubmitted changes shows up on the input stream.  Since revisions of
     files are normally sorted in time order, this should work in a number
     of cases.  I'm sure we'll need to generalize it, perhaps with a time
     thresholding function.
   - t/90cvs.t now tests cvs->p4 replication.
   - VCP::Dest::p4 now doesn't try to `p4 submit` when no changes are
     pending.
   - VCP::Rev now prevents the same label from being applied twice to
     a revision.  This was occuring because the "r_1"-style label that
     gets added to a target revision by VCP::Dest::p4 could duplicate
     a label "r_1" that happened to already be on a revision.
   - Added t/00rev.t, the beginnings of a test suite for VCP::Rev.
   - Tweaked bin/gentrevml to comment revisions with their change number
     instead of using a unique comment for every revision for non-p4
     t/test-*-in-0.revml files.  This was necessary to test cvs->p4
     functionality.

0.01 Sat Dec  2 23:10:43 EST 2000
   - First public release.  Moderately functional alpha code.  Supports
     p4, cvs, RevML.  Expect APIs, UIs and enerthing else to change before
     things settle down.
