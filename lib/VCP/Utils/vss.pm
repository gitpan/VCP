VCP::Utils::vss - utilities for dealing with the vss command

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   use VCP::Utils::vss ;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A mix-in class providing methods shared by VCP::Source::vss and VCP::Dest::vss,
mostly wrappers for calling the vss command.

=head1 METHODS

=item ss

Calls the vss command with the appropriate vssroot option.

TODO: See if we can use two different users to do vss->vss.  Not sure if VSS
sets the cp and workfold per machine or per user.

=item get_vss_file_list

Retrieves a list of all files and directories under a particular
path.  We need this so we can tell what dirs and files need to be added.
